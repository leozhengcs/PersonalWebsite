        Hi! I'm <i>Leo Zheng</i>, an aspiring data scientist that also has a passion for web dev. My journey started in 2020, in
        my highschool coding class where I was exposed to my first coding language - Python, and immediately fell in love. Coding to me
        is a test of not only your practical knowledge skills, but also numerous other skills such as problem solving, teamwork, and communication.
        Since the start of my journey, I have completed a diploma in Computer Systems Technology at BCIT and gained proficiency in a number
        of languages; some of which include: Python, Javascript, C, Java, NextJS, etc. Looking ahead, I plan on further developing my skills by
        completing certifications and building more projects.
